## An Example of polygons on the maps (Based on MapBox GL JS)
### Draw polygons without any overlap

#### MapBox GL JS
In this example [MapBox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) is used to render the map on the HTML content. MapBoxGl is a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps from vector tiles and Mapbox styles.

#### Turf JS
Also, [TurfJs](https://turfjs.org/) is used to calculate difference between polygons and some other utilities. Turf is a geospatial analysis library that provides a lot of geography and spatial calculations for the javascript ecosystem.

#### Parcel
And Finally, Parcel is used to bundle javascript and other assets. [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is a web application bundler with zero configuration and good performance.
